# Acknowledgement

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have contributed to the successful completion of this **College Website Management System** project.

First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt thanks to my project guide and faculty members of the Computer Science Department for their invaluable guidance, continuous support, and encouragement throughout the development of this backend-focused web application.

I am deeply grateful to my professors who provided me with the theoretical foundation in web development technologies, database management systems, and software engineering principles that were essential for this project.

Special thanks to the open-source community and the developers of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js whose excellent documentation and community support made this project possible.

I would also like to acknowledge my fellow students and colleagues who provided feedback during the testing phase and helped identify areas for improvement.

Finally, I thank my family and friends for their patience and moral support during the intensive development period of this project.

This project has been a significant learning experience in full-stack development with a strong emphasis on backend architecture, RESTful API design, and database modeling using MongoDB.
