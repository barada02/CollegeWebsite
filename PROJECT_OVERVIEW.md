## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

### Public Website Flow
1. User visits public routes (/, /about, /academics, etc.)
2. React components fetch data from Express API
3. Data is retrieved from MongoDB and returned as JSON
4. Components render the data with responsive UI

### Admin Dashboard Flow
1. Admin logs in through authentication system
2. JWT token is stored and used for subsequent requests
3. Admin performs CRUD operations through protected routes
4. Changes are reflected in MongoDB and updated in UI
5. Real-time feedback provided to admin users

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Password Security**: bcryptjs for secure password hashing
- **Input Validation**: express-validator for server-side validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing properly configured
- **Protected Routes**: Admin routes require authentication
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in .env files
