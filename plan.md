Server Implementation Plan - Step by Step
I'll guide you through implementing the server-side components in a structured way:

1. Server Structure Setup
Create the main server file (src/index.ts)

Configure Express server
Set up middleware (CORS, JSON parsing)
Connect to MongoDB using your connection string
Define basic error handling
Create the data model (src/models/Data.ts)

Define a Mongoose schema for our data
Create interfaces for TypeScript type safety
Export the model for use in controllers
Create controllers (src/controllers/dataController.ts)

Implement function to get all data records
Implement function to create a new data record
Add proper error handling
Create routes (src/routes/data.ts)

Define GET endpoint to fetch all data
Define POST endpoint to create new data
Connect routes to the appropriate controller functions
2. Implementation Order
First implement the model - defines our data structure
Then implement the controllers - contains the business logic
Next implement the routes - defines the API endpoints
Finally implement the main server file - ties everything together
3. Testing Plan
Test MongoDB connection
Test API endpoints using a tool like Postman or Thunder Client
Test GET endpoint to ensure it returns data
Test POST endpoint to ensure it creates data
Once we've confirmed the server is working properly, we'll move on to implementing the frontend components. This approach ensures we have a stable API before connecting it to the user interface.







Client-Side Implementation Plan
For the Next.js frontend, I'll create a simple two-page application with the following structure:

1. Project Structure
src/lib/api.ts - API service to communicate with our backend
src/app/page.tsx - Home page to display data from the database
src/app/form/page.tsx - Form page to add new data
src/components/ - Reusable components for our UI
2. Implementation Steps
Step 1: API Service
Create an API service module that:

Defines types for our data
Provides functions to fetch data from the backend
Provides functions to send data to the backend
Step 2: Home Page
Create a home page that:

Fetches and displays all data from the backend
Shows a loading state while data is being fetched
Displays each data item in a card format
Includes a button to navigate to the form page
Auto-refreshes when returning from the form page
Step 3: Form Page
Create a form page that:

Provides input fields for title and description
Validates user input
Submits data to the backend
Shows loading state during submission
Redirects back to home page after successful submission
Displays errors if submission fails
Step 4: Navigation
Implement navigation between pages:

Link from home page to form page
Automatic redirect from form to home after submission
Cancel button on form to return to home
3. Data Flow
User visits home page → Frontend fetches data from backend → Data displayed to user
User clicks "Add New Data" → Navigates to form page
User fills form and submits → Data sent to backend → Backend saves to MongoDB
User redirected to home page → Frontend fetches updated data → New data displayed
This approach ensures a clean separation between data fetching, display, and creation while providing a smooth user experience.
